# Coding conventions ###################################################
#

Code in the repository should conform to standards defined by the files
  Brocade-BSC/xt/perlcriticrc
  Brocade-BSC/xt/perltidyrc

Perl::Critic and Perl::Tidy are run as part of the author/extra test suite.

Test::Perl::Critic should be installed on development/test machines, so that
the coding convention tests are not skipped.

To tidy code prior to commit, run perltidy with the repository perltidyrc:

$ perltidy -b -p /path/to/xt/perltidyrc foo.pm
[diff foo.pm.bak against foo.pm]
$ rm foo.pm.bak
